* Python Libraries: Install the required Python libraries:
                                * PySpark
                                * Plotly     
                                * Pandas
## ðŸš€ Usage
* Data Input: Place your CSV file named visa_number_in_japan.csv in the input directory.
* Run the Script: Execute the provided Python script.
* Visualizations: After execution, you'll find the visualizations saved as HTML files in the output directory.
* Cleaned Data: The cleaned data will also be saved as a CSV file in the output director


## ðŸ“ˆ Features

* System Architecture: The Spark master-worker architecture is set up in a Docker container on Azure.
* Data Ingestion: The script ingests the CSV file containing the visa numbers in Japan.
* Data Cleaning: The script standardizes column names, drops null columns, and corrects country names using fuzzy matching.
* Data Transformation: The data is further enriched by adding continent information for each country.
* Data Visualization: The cleaned and transformed data is visualized using Plotly Express to provide insights into visa trends in Japan.
